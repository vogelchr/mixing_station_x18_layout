This is my default layout for Mixing Station, which is a remote control
application for a Behringer XR18 Audio Mixer.

Changes to the original layout:

 == On the right: ==

  * Layers & Fine/Mute/SoF buttons in one column on the right side

  * Mutegroups (MG1..4) and Fx1..4 mutes (mute of FX send busses) buttons
    The buttons need a long button press to activate.
  * Master controls for "Monitor 1, Monitor 2" (Aux 1 & 2)

  * Master channelstrip always visible (independent of selected layer)

 == On top: ==

  * StRet (Aux) volume control always visible

  * Mutes for all busses (labeled Mon 1..4 and Sub 1, 2)
    The buttons need a long button press to activate.
