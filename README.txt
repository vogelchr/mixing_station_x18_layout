This is my default layout for Mixing Station, which is a remote control
application for a Behringer XR18 or X32 Audio Mixer (or the Midas XM32).

Changes to the original layout:

 == On the left: ==

  * Direct access to mixes.
  * Volume knob for Bus 1 and Bus 2 (in my case: Monitor 1 and 2)

 == On the right: ==

  * Layers & Fine/Mute/SoF buttons in one column on the right side
  * Mutegroups and Fx1..4 mutes (mute of FX send busses) buttons
    The buttons need a long button press to activate.

  * Master channelstrip always visible (independent of selected layer)

 == On top: ==

  * StRet (Aux) volume control always visible

  * Mutes for busses
    The buttons need a long button press to activate.

How to use:
===========

These files need to be placed into the user-accessible storage below the
mixing station directory, in my case it's...

    /storage/emulated/0/MixingStation

Screenshots
===========
    
See screenshots in the screenshot directory.
